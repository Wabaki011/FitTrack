        "title": "How to Choose Your Lifts and Progress",
        "weightSelection": "For each exercise, start with a weight you can lift for the target number of reps with good form. The last 1-2 reps of each set should be challenging, but not impossible. If you can't complete the minimum number of reps, the weight is too heavy. If you can easily complete more than the maximum, it's too light.",
        "progression": "The goal is to gradually increase the demand on your muscles. Each week, try to do one of the following for each main exercise: \n1. Add a small amount of weight (e.g., 2.5kg / 5lbs). \n2. Do one more rep per set than you did last week with the same weight. \nOnce you can complete all sets for the top end of the rep range, you should increase the weight.",
        "rest": "Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets for smaller exercises, and 2-3 minutes for heavy compound lifts like squats and deadlifts.",
        "form": "Prioritize good form over heavy weight. Watch videos of the exercises and consider recording yourself to check your technique."
